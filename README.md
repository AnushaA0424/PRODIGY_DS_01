# PRODIGY_DS_01
This project is part of my internship with PRODIGY INFOTECH. The task focuses on visualizing population data using Python. I created a bar chart/histogram to show the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable (e.g., gender or age distribution in a population). Dataset Source: World Bank Population Dataset
